With a foundation in web technologies, I’ve evolved my expertise to specialize in software engineering and product
management within the mobile tech space. My journey has led me to focus on how mobile innovations can drive community
growth. I completed my Master of Technology in Software Engineering at the Institute of Systems Science, National
University of Singapore (NUS) in 2023.

    I’ve had the privilege of contributing to projects recognized for excellence, including the Best Mobile Trading Platform
    Singapore in 2022 and 2023, and have managed trading applications that serve users across Southeast Asia.

During my university years, I co-founded the White Heart Donation and Charity Group in Yangon, which supports orphans at
Buddhist temples—a venture that has kept me connected to community service. As I continue my career, I’m now exploring
opportunities in platform engineering and product management.

When I’m not immersed in tech, I love trying out new activities, practicing mindfulness and yoga, staying active,
reading, and learning the piano.
