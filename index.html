<p>
    I specialize in software engineering and product management within mobile technology. My passion lies in leveraging
    mobile innovations to foster community growth. I graduated in 2023 with a Master of Technology in Software Engineering
    from the Institute of Systems Science, National
    University of Singapore (NUS).

<p>
    I’ve contributed to award-winning solutions, including the Best Mobile Trading Platform Singapore 2022 & 2023, and
    managed corporate-level trading applications across Southeast Asia.

<p>
    At university, I co-founded the White Heart Donation and Charity Group in Yangon, supporting orphans at Buddhist
    temples—a venture that deepened my commitment to community service. I’m currently exploring a transition into platform
    engineering and product management.

    Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring new activities, practicing mindfulness, yoga, working out, reading, and playing piano.
