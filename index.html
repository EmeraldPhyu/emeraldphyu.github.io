<p>
    I am a Software Engineer and Product Management Specialist in Mobile Technology. My interests lie in the application of
    mobile technologies and the creation of innovative products, which I believe serve to help communities grow. I am a 2023
    alumnus of the Master of Technology in Software Engineering program at the Institute of Systems Science, National
    University of Singapore (NUS).

Previously, I worked on award-winning solutions such as the Best Mobile Trading Platform Singapore 2022 & 2023. I have
also managed end-to-end processes for corporate-level trading applications across Southeast Asia.

During my time at university, I co-founded the White Heart Donation and Charity Group in Yangon to support orphans at
Buddhist temples. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of giving back to communities. I am currently
exploring ways to transition from software engineering into platform engineering and product management.

When Iâ€™m not doing tech-related work, I enjoy exploring new activities, practicing mindfulness, doing yoga, working out,
reading, and writing.
