subtitle: Engineer of Ideas | Builder of Platforms | Advocate for Community and Creativity

<p>
With roots in web technologies, I’ve grown into a curious explorer of software engineering and product management across
diverse platforms. My passion lies in crafting innovative tech solutions that inspire community growth. In 2023, I
earned my Master of Technology in Software Engineering from the Institute of Systems Science, National University of
Singapore (NUS).

My work has made an impact—contributing to award-winning projects like the Best Trading Platform in Singapore (2022 &
2023) and overseeing trading applications used by thousands across Southeast Asia.

Beyond tech, my heart beats for community service. During my university years, I co-founded the White Heart Donation and Charity Group in Yangon, which supports orphans at
Buddhist temples. While the initiative is temporarily paused due to the political situation in Myanmar, its impact on
the community remains close to my heart, and I hope to revive it when circumstances allow.

<p>
As I chart my next steps, I’m diving deeper into platform engineering and product management, ready to tackle challenges
that merge innovation with meaningful outcomes.

<p>
Outside work, I’m always up for adventure—trying new activities, practicing mindfulness and yoga, staying active,
devouring books, and dabbling in piano melodies. Life’s too short to stop learning and creating!
