I am a Research Scientist in the AI Speech team at Meta AI, where I build robust on-device speech recognition models. My
research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.

Previously, I was a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, working in the Center for Language and Speech Processing
(CLSP), advised by Sanjeev Khudanpur and Dan Povey. I was a JHU-Amazon AI2AI fellow, a Fred Jelinek fellow, and an IEEE
Rising Star in Signal Processing.

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and read fiction.
